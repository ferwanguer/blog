I got my Bachelor’s degree from the [Polytechnic University of Madrid](https://www.etsiae.upm.es/) in aerospace engineering. That was the last time I studied about something resembling an aircraft. I got my Master’s degree from [TU Berlin](https://www.tu.berlin/) and [TU Delft](https://www.tudelft.nl/en/) in Applied Mathematics, which is what I really liked. This way, my "formal" academic path ended in 2021 after 6 years, paving the way to a never ending "non-ruled" learning journey. Prefering to return to Spain instead of studying a PhD abroad (A PhD in Spain is the equivalent of taking a vow of poverty), I started working for the private sector in Madrid.

I've worked in [GMV](https://gmv.com/es-es) as a Systems Engineer and then in [Capgemini](https://www.capgemini.com/) as a Data Scientist. Now, I work at [Airbus](https://www.airbus.com/en) in Getafe (Madrid, Spain) as a DevOps Engineer. 


In my free time, I use to practise some sport in a non-consistent manner to free up my mind. I take pleasure in reading and really enjoy writing—two severely underrated abilities, in my opinion.


That's it.
